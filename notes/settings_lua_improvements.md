# Settings.lua Improvements

## Summary
The `settings.lua` file has been improved with robust type checking, input validation, and error handling to ensure the mod's settings are always correctly accessed and applied.

## Changes Made

### Type Checking & Validation
- Enhanced type validation for all settings values
- Explicit conversions for all settings (number, boolean)
- Boundary enforcement for numeric values (teleport radius)
- Safe fallbacks to default values when needed

### Error Handling
- Improved handling of missing or nil settings values
- Added graceful degradation to default values
- Type checking to prevent runtime errors

### Documentation
- Updated file header with comprehensive documentation
- Added error handling documentation
- Clarified boundaries and constraints on settings values

## Lifecycle Considerations
After review, it was determined that `settings.lua` and `prototypes/settings.lua` serve different purposes in the Factorio mod lifecycle:

1. **prototypes/settings.lua**
   - Uses `data:extend()` API available only during the data stage
   - Defines the settings UI elements and their constraints
   - Should not be merged with settings.lua due to lifecycle concerns

2. **settings.lua**
   - Provides runtime access to the settings defined in prototypes
   - Contains validation and default handling logic
   - Used by other modules that need settings values

Therefore, these files are kept separate to respect Factorio's mod loading stages.

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a settings validation layer that can be used by multiple modules
- Add settings caching to improve performance for frequently accessed settings
- Consider a settings observer pattern to notify modules when settings change
