# Delete Button Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary
The delete button functionality for the tag editor has been successfully implemented according to all specified requirements.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. **Delete Button Creation & Placement**
- ✅ Delete button created in `build_owner_row()` function
- ✅ Properly positioned in the tag editor GUI
- ✅ Uses correct sprite (`Enum.SpriteEnum.TRASH`) and style (`tf_delete_button`)

### 2. **Button Enablement Logic** 
- ✅ Implemented in `setup_tag_editor_ui()` function
- ✅ **MOD RULE 1**: Only tag owner can delete (`tag.chart_tag.last_user == player.name`)
- ✅ **MOD RULE 2**: Button disabled if tag is favorited by other players
- ✅ Properly checks `tag.faved_by_players` array
- ✅ New tags (no existing chart_tag) are deletable by creator

### 3. **Confirmation Dialog**
- ✅ `build_confirmation_dialog()` function implemented
- ✅ Modal dialog with proper message
- ✅ Confirm and Cancel buttons with appropriate sprites
- ✅ Proper modal behavior (`player.opened` set correctly)

### 4. **Event Handling**
- ✅ `handle_delete_btn()` - Opens confirmation dialog
- ✅ `handle_delete_confirm()` - Executes deletion with validation
- ✅ `handle_delete_cancel()` - Closes dialog, returns to tag editor
- ✅ Event handlers registered in `on_tag_editor_gui_click()`

### 5. **Deletion Logic**
- ✅ Re-validates permissions before deletion
- ✅ Uses existing `tag_destroy_helper.destroy_tag_and_chart_tag()`
- ✅ Clears `tag_editor_data` storage
- ✅ Closes both confirmation dialog and tag editor
- ✅ Shows success message to user

### 6. **Error Handling**
- ✅ Shows error if permissions change during confirmation
- ✅ Keeps tag editor open on permission errors
- ✅ Proper cleanup of GUI elements

### 7. **User Feedback**
- ✅ Added `tf-gui.tag_deleted_successfully` locale string
- ✅ User receives confirmation message after successful deletion
