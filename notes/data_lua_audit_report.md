# data.lua Audit Results and Improvements

## Date: June 12, 2025

## Issues Found
1. **Inconsistent Formatting**
   - Spacing inconsistencies throughout the file
   - Mixed spacing after type definitions
   - Irregular indentation in some sprite and font definitions

2. **Missing Localization**
   - Custom inputs lacked proper localised_name and localised_description properties
   - No consistent pattern for order properties on custom inputs

3. **Missing Locale Entries**
   - References to shortcut-name and shortcut-description had no corresponding locale entries

4. **Minor Syntax Issues**
   - In tf_star_disabled sprite definition, alpha value was incorrectly defined

## Improvements Made
1. **Enhanced Custom Input Definitions**
   - Added localized name and description to all teleport favorite shortcuts (10 entries)
   - Added localized name and description to the tag editor shortcut
   - Added localized name and description to the data viewer toggle shortcut

2. **Created Locale File for Shortcuts**
   - Added shortcuts.cfg with organized entries for all shortcuts
   - Included proper localization support for dynamic properties (e.g., favorite slot numbers)

3. **Formatting Fixes**
   - Fixed spacing between sprite/font definitions 
   - Corrected alpha value in tf_star_disabled sprite tint definition
   - Ensured consistent structure throughout all definitions

4. **Order Properties**
   - Ensured all custom inputs have proper order properties for consistent menu display

## Files Modified
- v:\Fac2orios\2_Gemini\mods\TeleportFavorites\data.lua
- v:\Fac2orios\2_Gemini\mods\TeleportFavorites\locale\en\shortcuts.cfg (new file)
- v:\Fac2orios\2_Gemini\mods\TeleportFavorites\changelog.txt

## Future Recommendations
1. Consider grouping related definitions together in data.lua for better organization
2. Create a style guide for prototype definitions to ensure consistency
3. Add validation for locale entries when adding new UI elements
4. Consider adding helper functions for common prototype creation patterns
