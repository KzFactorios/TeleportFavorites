1. Off-by-One Slot Indices Returns Non-Nil Favorite
Error:
Expected nil or blank favorite, got: {locked=false,gps="000.000.1",}

Action:

Ensure that PlayerFavorites:get_all()[slot] (or similar) returns nil for out-of-bounds indices (e.g., 0, -1, >MAX).
If your code always returns a favorite object (even for invalid slots), update the test to accept this as a blank favorite only if it matches your BLANK_GPS sentinel.
Update the is_blank_favorite helper to match your actual blank favorite structure, or update the code to return nil for invalid slots.
2. Handles Duplicate GPS and Tag Entries
Error:
assertion failed!

Action:

Review the test: ensure it is not expecting two different favorites for the same GPS/tag.
In your code, enforce that only one favorite per unique GPS is allowed per player/surface.
Update the test to check for correct deduplication or update the code to deduplicate on insert.
3. Maximum Allowed Favorite Slots (Upper Boundary)
Error:
Expected nil or blank favorite, got: table: ...

Action:

Ensure that accessing a slot above the maximum allowed returns nil or a blank favorite (with BLANK_GPS).
Update the test to use the is_blank_favorite helper, and ensure the helper matches the actual blank favorite structure.
In your code, prevent setting or getting favorites at indices > MAX_FAVORITE_SLOTS.
4. Nil Value (method 'get_favorites')
Error:
attempt to call a nil value (method 'get_favorites')

Action:

Check the test and mocks: ensure the object being called has a get_favorites method.
If using a mock, update it to include a stub for get_favorites.
If the method was renamed (e.g., to get_all), update the test to use the correct method name.
Summary Table
Issue	Fix in Code	Fix in Test	Fix in Mock
Off-by-one slot	Return nil or blank favorite for invalid slot	Accept only nil/BLANK_GPS as blank	N/A
Duplicate GPS/tag	Deduplicate on insert	Assert only one favorite per GPS	N/A
Max slot boundary	Return nil or blank favorite for >MAX	Accept only nil/BLANK_GPS as blank	N/A
Nil method error	Ensure method exists on object	Use correct method name	Add stub if needed
Next Steps
Refactor PlayerFavorites to strictly enforce valid slot indices and deduplication.
Update the is_blank_favorite helper and all related test assertions to match your blank favorite structure (using BLANK_GPS).
Update or fix mocks to include all required methods.
Rerun the tests and review any new output for further issues.
