# Map Reticle Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to implement the map targeting reticle feature in the TeleportFavorites mod. The key change was separating the reticle visualization functionality (now available to all players) from the Positionator GUI (which remains a developer-only feature).

## Changes Made

1. **New Player Setting**:
   - Added `map-reticle-on` setting to enable/disable the reticle
   - Default value is `true` (enabled)
   - Added appropriate locale strings for the setting

2. **Modified Functions**:
   - `Positionator.on_player_selected_area()`: Now checks player setting before showing reticle
   - `Positionator.on_tick()`: Now checks player setting before continuing with reticle display
   - `Positionator.on_nth_tick()`: Removed dev mode check, now accessible to all players
   - `Positionator.visualize_map_preview()`: Added check for player setting before rendering
   - `Positionator.on_display_change()`: Now separates GUI refresh (dev mode only) from reticle refresh
   - `Positionator.on_map_view_change()`: Removed dev mode check

3. **Visual Optimizations**:
   - Added adaptive rendering based on zoom level
   - Added throttling for position updates
   - Added scaling of visual elements for better visibility at different zoom levels

4. **Documentation**:
   - Created `map_reticle_feature.md` documenting the feature
   - Updated `enabling_dev_mode.md` to clarify what remains dev-mode only

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. **Regular Mode (No Dev Mode)**:
   - The reticle should appear when right-clicking in map view
   - The setting should correctly toggle the reticle on/off
   - Visual elements should adapt based on zoom level

2. **Developer Mode**:
   - The Positionator GUI should only appear when in dev mode
   - The reticle should work regardless of dev mode setting

## Technical Details

The implementation uses a simple state machine approach:

1. When right-clicking in map view, `on_player_selected_area` is triggered
2. This creates a map preview data entry for the player
3. The `on_nth_tick` event handler updates the cursor position at a throttled rate
4. The `visualize_map_preview` function renders the visuals based on player settings and zoom level
5. When right-click is released or map view is exited, the preview is cleared

This approach separates the reticle visualization from the position adjustment GUI while allowing both features to share code for visualization and event handling.

## Next Steps

- Consider adding more customization options for reticle appearance
- Add option to show nearby tag positions within search radius
- Consider adding a keybind to toggle reticle visibility
