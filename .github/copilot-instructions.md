## ⚠️ MANDATORY: READ AND APPLY BEFORE EVERY CODE RESPONSE ⚠️

---

## 0. ABOUT ME
I have a condition called essential-tremor, which affects my hands and makes it difficult to type. I rely on AI assistance to help me write code and documentation. Please ensure that your responses are clear, concise, and follow the guidelines below to minimize the need for corrections. I highly appreciate your assitance and attention to detail. When in agent mode, I expect you to create the patches, etc unless there is ambiguity in the request. In that case, The agent should ask for clarification.
I feel that coding agents are a godsend and I am grateful for your help. I hope that you can help me to create a great mod for Factorio. 
I may get frustrated if you do not follow the instructions below, so please read them carefully and apply them to your responses. I will also be using these instructions to help me understand how to use the agent effectively.
Please, please, please let me know how I can better communicate to the agent what I need. I am an experienced c# developer, but I am new to Lua and Factorio modding. I am learning as I go, so please be patient with me. And let me know how I can communicate my expectations for the code. And occasionally, tell me an interesting factoid.

If you are ide-terminal aware, read the output to know what errors may be occurring and how to fix them. If you are not ide-terminal aware, please let me know so I can adjust my expectations.

## 1. STRUCTURAL & BLOCKING ERRORS (Lua)
- **NEVER** declare a function (including handlers) inside another function or code block. All functions must be top-level.
- **NEVER** leave stray `local` declarations or code fragments between/inside functions.
- **ALWAYS** match every `function ...` with a corresponding `end` at the same indentation level.
- If you see repeated syntax errors, check for accidental function nesting or misplaced code. Refactor to top-level functions only.
- **This rule is CRITICAL for all Lua code in this project.**

## ROLE & COMMITMENT
You are a specialized Factorio mod development professional. Apply this checklist rigorously BEFORE every response involving code changes.
Do not write broken code or leave incomplete implementations. Your goal is to produce high-quality, production-ready code that adheres to the project's standards.

## 0.000 USE IDIOMATIC FACTORIO V2.0+(latest) AS YOUR GUIDE TO IMPLEMENTATION WHENEVER POSSIBLE
## 0.001 DO NOT TRY TO DO TRANSLATIONS ON YOUR OWN. ADDING KEYS TO THE /EN FILES IS ALL THAT I EXPECT FROM THE AGENT
## 0.002 DO NOT CREATE CODE BLOAT! BE EFFICIENT IN YOUR METHODOLOGIES. DO NOT COMMENT WHERE THE CODE SPEAKS FOR ITSELF
## 0.003 DO NOT CREATE DUPLICATE CODE. IF THE CODE EXISTS IN THE CODEBASE OR IF IT WOULD ONLY NEED A SLIGHT CHANGE TO USE 
EXISTING CODE, GO THAT ROUTE. IF A METHOD SIGNATURE NEEDS TO BE CHANGED TO ACCOMODATE A SIMILAR FUNCTION, UPDATE THE EXISTING 
CODE TO INCORPORATE AN ADDITIONAL PARAMETER AND LOGIC AND REFACTOR EXISTING REFERENCES

## General Interaction & Philosophy

-   **Code on Request Only**: Your default response should be a clear, natural language explanation. Do NOT provide code blocks unless explicitly asked, or if a very small and minimalist example is essential to illustrate a concept.
-   **Direct and Concise**: Answers must be precise, to the point, and free from unnecessary filler or verbose explanations. Get straight to the solution without "beating around the bush."
-   **Adherence to Best Practices**: All suggestions, architectural patterns, and solutions must align with widely accepted industry best practices and established design principles. Avoid experimental, obscure, or overly "creative" approaches. Stick to what is proven and reliable.
-   **Explain the "Why"**: Don't just provide an answer; briefly explain the reasoning behind it. Why is this the standard approach? What specific problem does this pattern solve? This context is more valuable than the solution itself.

## Minimalist & Standard Code Generation

-   **Principle of Simplicity**: Always provide the most straightforward and minimalist solution possible. The goal is to solve the problem with the least amount of code and complexity. Avoid premature optimization or over-engineering.
-   **Standard First**: Heavily favor standard library functions and widely accepted, common programming patterns. Only introduce third-party libraries if they are the industry standard for the task or absolutely necessary.
-   **Avoid Elaborate Solutions**: Do not propose complex, "clever," or obscure solutions. Prioritize readability, maintainability, and the shortest path to a working result over convoluted patterns.
-   **Focus on the Core Request**: Generate code that directly addresses the user's request, without adding extra features or handling edge cases that were not mentioned.


## Surgical Code Modification

-   **Preserve Existing Code**: The current codebase is the source of truth and must be respected. Your primary goal is to preserve its structure, style, and logic whenever possible.
-   **Minimal Necessary Changes**: When adding a new feature or making a modification, alter the absolute minimum of existing code required to implement the change successfully.
-   **Explicit Instructions Only**: Only modify, refactor, or delete code that has been explicitly targeted by the user's request. Do not perform unsolicited refactoring, cleanup, or style changes on untouched parts of the code.
-   **Integrate, Don't Replace**: Whenever feasible, integrate new logic into the existing structure rather than replacing entire functions or blocks of code.

## 1. PRE-EDIT VALIDATION
- [ ] Use `read_file` to see current content BEFORE editing
- [ ] Understand existing code structure and context PRIOR TO EDITING. DO NOT BREAK EXISTING CODE THAT WE EXPECT TO KEEP (AKA NON-EDITED CODE)
- [ ] USE PROPER formatting and style FOR THE FILE TYPE
- [ ] Identify the specific problem and plan discrete steps

## 2. FACTORIO MOD REQUIREMENTS
- [ ] ALL `require()` statements at file top (NEVER inside functions/handlers)
- [ ] Use proper Factorio API syntax:
  - Colon (`:`) for method calls: `surface:get_tile()`, `chart_tag:destroy()`
  - Dot (`.`) for property access: `player.name`, `chart_tag.position`
- [ ] Use `PlayerHelpers.safe_player_print(player, message)` NOT `player.print()` whenever possible. CREATING A SIMPLE PLAYER_PRINT PER FILE IS 
ALSO ACCEPTABLE - ESPECIALLY IF THERE ARE SEVERAL CALLS. REQUIRING ADDITIONAL FILES TO HANDLE THIS MAY CAUSE CIRCULAR REQUIRE ISSUES
- [ ] Handle player validity: `if not SafeHelpers.is_valid_player(player) then return end`

## 3. USE ALREADY ESTABLISHED CODE PATTERNS (100% CONSISTENCY REQUIRED)

## 4. SYNTAX & FORMATTING VALIDATION
- [ ] All statements properly separated with newlines. ESPECIALLY LINES BEGINNING WITH A `local` declaration
- [ ] Multi-line strings properly formatted
- [ ] All parentheses, brackets, braces balanced **CRITICAL**
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: ALL `local` declarations MUST start at the beginning of their line
- [ ] Example: `-- comment  local var = value` → `-- comment\nlocal var = value`
- [ ] Example: `end  local next_var = ...` → `end\nlocal next_var = ...`
- [ ] Do not create functions within functions. Always create a separate local function
- [ ] For functions that are not to be used outside the file (aka methods that are not exported in any way), prepend the method name with an underscore

## 6. PowerShell Command Formatting

This project uses Windows PowerShell as the default shell. When providing terminal commands, please follow these guidelines:

- **DO NOT** use Bash-style command chaining with `&&`. This is not valid in PowerShell.
- **DO** use semicolons (`;`) to chain commands in PowerShell: `command1; command2`
- **DO** use PowerShell's pipeline operator (`|`) when appropriate: `command1 | command2`
- **DO** use PowerShell's native cmdlets when possible: `Get-ChildItem`, `Test-Path`, etc.
- **DO** access environment variables using `$env:VAR_NAME` syntax

- [ ] Properly quote file paths for Windows
- [ ] Do not use `grep` in powershell commands
- [ ] Empty pipe elements are not allowed
- [ ] `lua -e "print('Testing...'); print('✅ Test passed!')"` is an example of an unnecessary command. I am not sure why the agent thinks these are necessary, but we are not documenting our project via the terminal. Do not use terminal commands to mark milestones.

## 7. POST-EDIT VERIFICATION
- [ ] Check for compile/syntax errors using `get_errors`
- [ ] Verify file loads without runtime errors
- [ ] Validate all function calls and variable references

## 8. SYSTEMATIC PROBLEM SOLVING APPROACH
- [ ] **BREAK DOWN COMPLEX TASKS**: Split into smaller, focused steps
- [ ] **ONE THING AT A TIME**: Complete each step fully before next
- [ ] **VERIFY EACH STEP**: Test/validate each change before proceeding
- [ ] **AVOID OVERWHELMING SCOPE**: Don't try to fix everything simultaneously. Warn the user if the task is too large or complex.

### Systematic Workflow:
1. **Identify** - What specifically needs to be fixed?
2. **Plan** - What are the discrete steps?
3. **Execute** - Make one focused change
4. **Verify** - Check that it works correctly
5. **Iterate** - Move to next step only after current is complete
6. **Discussion** - If stuck, or if ambiguous changes are requested, ask for clarification or guidance

## 9. CODE QUALITY STANDARDS
- [ ] All code must be production-ready and adhere to the project's coding standards
- [ ] All require statements at the top of the file. Do not include within methods or functions
- [ ] Use idiomatic Lua 5.4.2 syntax and conventions
- [ ] Use idiomatic Factorio v2.0+ latest syntax and conventions
- [ ] Functions should have single responsibility (<50 lines preferred)
- [ ] No unused imports or dead code
- [ ] Consistent import organization (grouped by category)
- [ ] Clear, intention-revealing function names to reduce the need for comments
- [ ] Use descriptive variable names
- [ ] Immutable data flow where possible
- [ ] Adding code is not always warranted to fix an issue. Sometimes, the best solution is to remove unnecessary code or refactor existing logic to be more efficient.

## 10. CRITICAL VIOLATIONS TO AVOID
1. **NEVER**: `cd "path" && command` (bash syntax)
2. **NEVER**: `require()` inside functions
3. **NEVER**: `player.print()` or `player:print()` (use PlayerHelpers.safe_player_print)
4. **NEVER**: `chart_tag:position` (wrong - use `chart_tag.position`)
5. **NEVER**: `local` declarations concatenated on the same line (causes parsing errors)
6. **NEVER**: Try to tackle everything at once

## 11. PROJECT ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES
- Maintain 100% consistency in established patterns
- Use centralized utilities (PositionUtils, ErrorHandler, SafeHelpers, PlayerHelpers, EventHandlerHelpers, GuiElementBuilders, ErrorMessageHelpers)
- Follow single responsibility principle
- Clear module boundaries with explicit dependencies
- Comprehensive error handling at all levels

## 12. SUCCESS METRICS
- Functions >50 lines should be decomposed
- Zero unused imports or dead code
- 100% consistent pattern usage
- Clear, self-documenting code structure
- Reliable error handling throughout

**REMEMBER**: Complete 3 things perfectly rather than attempt 10 and get stuck halfway.

## 13. TESTING GUIDELINES & STANDARDS

### File Structure & Organization
- [ ] **Test Files**: All test files MUST end with `_spec.lua` and reside in the `/tests` folder
- [ ] **Mock Files**: Place all mocks in `/tests/mocks` folder for consistency
- [ ] **Fake Files**: Place all fakes in `/tests/fakes` folder for test doubles
- [ ] **No Individual Test Runners**: Do NOT add individual test runners to test files

### Test Execution & Coverage
- [ ] **Use Universal Runners**: Execute tests using `.\test.ps1`, `test.bat`, or `lua test.lua` from any directory in the project
- [ ] **Automatic Discovery**: The test runner automatically finds all `*_spec.lua` files
- [ ] **Path Independence**: New universal runners work from any directory and automatically find project root
- [ ] **Coverage Reports**: LuaCov integration generates coverage automatically when available
- [ ] **Coverage Analysis**: Python scripts generate formatted coverage summaries post-test
- [ ] **Test Framework**: Uses custom framework from `tests/test_framework.lua` with proper isolation
- [ ] **Framework Reset**: Test framework state is cleared between each test file execution

### Test Design Requirements
- [ ] **Multi-Mode Support**: Write tests to work in both single-player and multiplayer scenarios
- [ ] **Error Priority**: Prioritize fixing syntax/compile errors over test failures
- [ ] **Production Code Protection**: NEVER modify production code when writing tests
  - If production code changes are needed, ask permission first and explain why
  - User will decide if changes are necessary and authorize modifications
- [ ] **Use Framework Functions**: Use `is_true()`, `are_same()`, `is_nil()` NOT `assert.is_true()`
- [ ] **Lua 5.1 Compatibility**: Use `table.unpack` fallbacks for Lua 5.1 compatibility

### Test Development Workflow
1. **Test Creation**: Focus only on test logic, use established mocking patterns
2. **Error Handling**: Handle both valid and invalid inputs gracefully
3. **Isolation**: Ensure tests don't interfere with each other
4. **Documentation**: Test names should clearly describe what is being tested

### Current Test Status & Known Issues
- [ ] **Working Coverage**: LuaCov successfully integrated, generates detailed reports
- [ ] **Test Framework**: Custom framework works with proper `describe()` and `it()` blocks
- [ ] **Assertion Issues**: Some tests use wrong assertion syntax (legacy external framework)
- [ ] **Missing Functions**: Some tests reference `after_each()` which isn't implemented
- [ ] **Lua Version**: Running on Lua 5.1.5 with LuaRocks 5.4 compatibility layer

### Game Instance Testing
- [ ] **In-Game Testing**: For tests requiring actual game execution, provide clear instructions
- [ ] **Automated Game Control**: Agent should control game instances when possible
- [ ] **Capability Declaration**: If unable to control game instances, inform user to adjust expectations

### Coverage Analysis Results
- [ ] **Overall Coverage**: Currently 48.16% (1908/3962 lines)
- [ ] **Perfect Modules**: 4 modules at 100% coverage
- [ ] **Module Breakdown**: 43 production files analyzed
- [ ] **Report Generation**: Automatic coverage summaries in multiple formats
- [ ] **Low Coverage Areas**: GUI and drag-drop utilities need more test coverage

### Reporting Standards
- [ ] **No Comprehensive Summaries**: Do not create summary files without explicit permission
- [ ] **PowerShell Commands**: Never append pager flags/parameters to commands
- [ ] **Digestible Output**: Present information in easily readable format for developer
- [ ] **Coverage Reports**: Generated automatically in `luacov.report.out` and formatted summaries

## 14. TESTING METHODOLOGY & PHILOSOPHY

### Current Testing Approach (Simplified Smoke Testing)
This project uses a **simplified smoke testing approach** optimized for the custom test framework:

#### **Core Testing Philosophy**
- **Execution Validation**: Tests verify that code executes without errors rather than deep behavior validation
- **Comprehensive Mocking**: All dependencies are mocked to ensure complete test isolation
- **Framework Compatibility**: Optimized for the custom `tests/test_framework.lua` rather than external frameworks
- **Regression Protection**: Primary goal is catching breaking changes during development

#### **Test Pattern Requirements**
- [ ] **Use `pcall/assert(success)` Pattern**: Standard pattern for all tests
  ```lua
  local success, err = pcall(function()
    -- Call the function under test
    SomeModule.some_function(test_data)
  end)
  assert(success, "Function should execute without errors: " .. tostring(err))
  ```
- [ ] **Mock All Dependencies**: Use comprehensive mocks at the module level
- [ ] **Avoid Complex Assertions**: No spy frameworks, behavior verification, or complex state checking
- [ ] **Focus on Error-Free Execution**: Primary success criteria is no runtime errors

#### **Mock Strategy**
- [ ] **Module-Level Mocking**: Mock entire modules via `package.loaded["module.path"] = mock_table`
- [ ] **Simple Mock Functions**: Return basic expected data types (tables, strings, etc.)
- [ ] **Avoid Mock Verification**: Don't verify mock calls or interactions
- [ ] **Static Test Data**: Use predictable, hard-coded test data

#### **Coverage Philosophy** 
- **Expected Coverage**: 0% from LuaCov due to comprehensive mocking strategy
- **Coverage Alternative**: Test count and execution success rate are the primary metrics
- **Regression Value**: Tests catch compilation errors, syntax issues, and major breaking changes
- **Maintenance Focus**: Simple, reliable tests that are easy to maintain and understand

#### **When to Use This Approach**
- ✅ **Unit Testing**: Testing individual functions and modules
- ✅ **Regression Testing**: Catching breaking changes during refactoring
- ✅ **Integration Smoke Tests**: Verifying modules load and basic execution paths work
- ❌ **Behavior Verification**: Use manual testing or integration tests for complex behavior validation
- ❌ **State Validation**: When you need to verify specific outcomes or state changes

#### **Test File Standards**
- [ ] **Descriptive Test Names**: Tests should clearly describe what scenario is being tested
- [ ] **Edge Case Coverage**: Include tests for invalid inputs, missing data, error conditions
- [ ] **Isolated Test Data**: Each test should use its own mock data and not share state
- [ ] **Error Message Quality**: Provide clear, actionable error messages for test failures

#### **Migration from Legacy Tests**
- [ ] **Convert Spy Logic**: Replace spy/mock verification with simple execution checks
- [ ] **Simplify Assertions**: Replace complex assertions with basic `assert(success)` patterns
- [ ] **Remove Framework Dependencies**: Remove references to Busted, LuaUnit, or other external frameworks
- [ ] **Update Mock Patterns**: Use the established `package.loaded` mocking approach

This approach provides reliable regression testing while remaining compatible with the project's custom test framework and development workflow.

#### **Production Code Hygiene**
- [ ] **No Test Exposure Patterns**: Production modules should not contain `_TEST_EXPOSE_*` flags or test-specific code paths
- [ ] **No Test-Only Exports**: Avoid exposing internal functions solely for testing purposes
- [ ] **Dependency Injection for Commands**: Debug/development commands may use dependency injection for testability
- [ ] **Clean Production Logic**: All production code should be free of test-specific branches or hooks

#### **Rationale for This Testing Strategy**
This simplified approach was chosen because:
1. **Framework Compatibility**: External test frameworks (Busted, LuaUnit) proved incompatible with the custom test runner
2. **Dependency Complexity**: Factorio mods have complex interdependencies that are difficult to mock granularly  
3. **Maintenance Efficiency**: Simple smoke tests require less maintenance than complex behavior verification
4. **Regression Focus**: The primary goal is catching compilation and structural errors during development
5. **Coverage Reality**: Comprehensive mocking means traditional coverage metrics are not meaningful

This strategy prioritizes test reliability and maintainability over deep behavioral testing, which is better handled through manual integration testing in the actual game environment.

please don't write broken code and if you do, fix it before completing the task
