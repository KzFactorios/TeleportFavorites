# Data Viewer Font Button Sprite Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The font size up/down buttons and refresh button in the Data Viewer were not displaying their intended sprites (arrow icons). Instead, they were showing question mark icons or no sprites at all.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `GuiUtils.validate_sprite()` function in `core/utils/gui_utils.lua`. This function validates sprite paths before creating buttons, and if a sprite is deemed invalid, it falls back to a question mark sprite.

The problem was that our custom arrow sprites (`tf_hint_arrow_up`, `tf_hint_arrow_down`) were not included in the sprite validation logic:

1. **Custom Sprites Not Recognized**: The validation function had a list of common vanilla sprites but didn't include our custom TeleportFavorites sprites
2. **Pattern Matching Failed**: The function checked for `__TeleportFavorites__` in sprite paths (for file paths), but our custom sprites use names like `tf_hint_arrow_up` without the mod path prefix

## Solution Applied

### 1. Enhanced Sprite Validation Function
Updated `GuiUtils.validate_sprite()` in `core/utils/gui_utils.lua` to include:

**Enhanced Vanilla Sprite List:**
```lua
local common_sprites = {
  "utility/add", "utility/remove", "utility/close", "utility/refresh",
  "utility/arrow-up", "utility/arrow-down", "utility/arrow-left", "utility/arrow-right",
  "utility/questionmark", "utility/check_mark", "utility/warning_icon",
  "utility/trash", "utility/copy", "utility/edit", "utility/enter",
  "utility/confirm_slot", "utility/reset", "utility/danger_icon", "utility/info",
  "utility/export_slot", "utility/import_slot", "utility/list_view",
  "utility/lock", "utility/pin", "utility/play", "utility/search_icon", "utility/settings"
}
```

**Custom TeleportFavorites Sprites:**
```lua
local tf_custom_sprites = {
  "tf_hint_arrow_up", "tf_hint_arrow_down", "tf_hint_arrow_left", "tf_hint_arrow_right",
  "tf_star_disabled", "move_tag_icon", "logo_36", "logo_144"
}
```

### 2. Sprite Definitions Verified
Confirmed that the custom sprites are properly defined in `data.lua`:
- `tf_hint_arrow_up` - defined with correct graphics coordinates
- `tf_hint_arrow_down` - defined with correct graphics coordinates  
- `tf_hint_arrow_left` - defined with correct graphics coordinates
- `tf_hint_arrow_right` - defined with correct graphics coordinates

### 3. Data Viewer Button Usage
The data viewer correctly uses these sprites:
- Font size down button: `Enum.SpriteEnum.ARROW_DOWN` ‚Üí `"tf_hint_arrow_down"`
- Font size up button: `Enum.SpriteEnum.ARROW_UP` ‚Üí `"tf_hint_arrow_up"`
- Refresh button: `Enum.SpriteEnum.REFRESH` ‚Üí `"utility/refresh"`

## Testing Added

### 1. Sprite Validation Test
Created `tests/test_font_button_sprites.lua` with commands:
- `/test-sprite-validation` - Tests the validation logic
- `/test-button-sprites` - Creates actual buttons to verify sprites display

### 2. Debug Logging Enhanced
The data viewer already includes debug logging that shows:
```lua
ErrorHandler.debug_log("Data viewer action buttons created", {
  font_down_valid = font_down_btn and font_down_btn.valid,
  font_up_valid = font_up_btn and font_up_btn.valid,
  refresh_valid = refresh_btn and refresh_btn.valid,
  font_down_sprite = font_down_btn and font_down_btn.sprite,
  font_up_sprite = font_up_btn and font_up_btn.sprite,
  refresh_sprite = refresh_btn and refresh_btn.sprite
})
```

## Expected Results

After this fix, when opening the Data Viewer (Ctrl+F12):

1. **Font Size Down Button** should display ‚¨áÔ∏è arrow icon (from `tf_hint_arrow_down`)
2. **Font Size Up Button** should display ‚¨ÜÔ∏è arrow icon (from `tf_hint_arrow_up`)  
3. **Refresh Button** should display üîÑ refresh icon (from `utility/refresh`)
4. **No Question Mark Icons** should appear on action buttons

## Files Modified

1. **`core/utils/gui_utils.lua`** - Enhanced `validate_sprite()` function
2. **`tests/test_font_button_sprites.lua`** - New test file for sprite validation

## Technical Notes

- The sprite validation function now properly recognizes both vanilla and custom sprites
- Custom sprites are defined in the data phase and should be available at runtime
- The validation prevents invalid sprites from causing GUI errors
- Fallback to question mark sprite still occurs for truly invalid sprite paths

## Status
‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Font size and refresh buttons should now display proper arrow and refresh icons instead of question marks or missing sprites.
