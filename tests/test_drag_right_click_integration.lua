-- Comprehensive integration test for drag-and-drop right-click cancellation
-- Tests all possible scenarios where a right-click should cancel drag operations

-- ========================================================================
-- HOW TO RUN THESE TESTS
-- These tests should be run manually in-game to verify the behavior
-- ========================================================================

-- TEST SCENARIO 1: Right-click on a GUI element (not favorites bar)
-- 1. Start dragging a favorite with Shift+Left-Click
-- 2. Right-click on any GUI element (inventory, crafting menu, etc.)
-- Expected: Drag should cancel, cursor should clear, notification should appear

-- TEST SCENARIO 2: Right-click on the map view
-- 1. Start dragging a favorite with Shift+Left-Click
-- 2. Right-click on the map view
-- Expected: Drag should cancel, cursor should clear, notification should appear, no tag editor should open

-- TEST SCENARIO 3: Right-click on a favorite slot
-- 1. Start dragging a favorite with Shift+Left-Click
-- 2. Right-click on any favorite slot
-- Expected: Drag should cancel, cursor should clear, notification should appear, no tag editor should open

-- TEST SCENARIO 4: Right-click immediately after cancellation
-- 1. Start dragging a favorite with Shift+Left-Click
-- 2. Right-click to cancel the drag
-- 3. Right-click on the map or a favorite
-- Expected: First right-click cancels drag, second right-click should behave normally (open tag editor)

-- TEST SCENARIO 5: Rapidly clicking through multiple drag operations
-- 1. Start dragging a favorite with Shift+Left-Click
-- 2. Right-click to cancel
-- 3. Immediately start dragging another favorite
-- 4. Right-click again to cancel
-- Expected: Both drag operations should cancel correctly with appropriate feedback

-- ========================================================================
-- IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
-- ========================================================================
--
-- The drag cancellation is handled in multiple places:
--
-- 1. GUI Event Dispatcher - (core/events/gui_event_dispatcher.lua)
--    - Handles right-clicks on GUI elements during drag
--    - Sets suppression flag to prevent tag editor opening
--
-- 2. Handlers - (core/events/handlers.lua)
--    - Handles right-clicks on map during drag
--    - Cancels drag and prevents tag editor from opening
--
-- 3. Control Fave Bar - (core/control/control_fave_bar.lua)
--    - Handles right-clicks on favorite slots during drag
--    - Added check in handle_favorite_slot_click for right-clicks during drag
--    - Added check in handle_request_to_open_tag_editor to prevent tag editor opening during drag

-- ========================================================================
-- TROUBLESHOOTING
-- ========================================================================
--
-- If drag fails to cancel on right-click:
--   1. Check if right-click event is being detected in the appropriate handler
--   2. Verify CursorUtils.end_drag_favorite is being called
--   3. Confirm player_data.drag_favorite.active is being set to false
--
-- If tag editor opens during drag cancellation:
--   1. Check suppression flag is being set properly
--   2. Verify the handler for opening tag editor is checking for active drags
--   3. Make sure right-click event is being properly consumed (return true)
