-- Test: Icon preservation from tag editor to favorites bar
-- This test verifies that when a favorite is created from the tag editor,
-- the icon from chart_tag.icon is properly preserved and displayed in the favorites bar
-- 
-- The flow is:
-- 1. Tag has chart_tag.icon (runtime userdata)
-- 2. During sanitization, chart_tag is removed for storage
-- 3. During rehydration (via FavoriteRehydration), chart_tag is restored from cache
-- 4. Favorites bar displays the icon from the rehydrated chart_tag.icon
