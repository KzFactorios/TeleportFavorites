# TeleportFavorites Coding Standards

_All coding standards, best practices, and agent instructions for this mod are maintained in a single authoritative source:_

**See: `.github/copilot-instructions.md`**

This file is intentionally minimal to avoid duplication and ensure the agent always references the most up-to-date, DRY documentation. All contributors and automated agents must follow the rules and patterns described in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

For any coding, architectural, or deployment questions, consult `.github/copilot-instructions.md` as the canonical source.

---

*If you believe a standard is missing or unclear, update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` directly.*



## Changelog Format & Verification

All changelog formatting rules, verification requirements, and automation scripts (including changelog validation) are maintained in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

Before packaging or releasing, ensure the changelog is validated using the prescribed script and matches the strict Factorio mod format. For details, see the Changelog section in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
