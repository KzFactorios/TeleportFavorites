# TeleportFavorites Coding Standards

_All coding standards, best practices, and agent instructions for this mod are maintained in a single authoritative source:_

**See: `.github/copilot-instructions.md`**

This file is intentionally minimal to avoid duplication and ensure the agent always references the most up-to-date, DRY documentation. All contributors and automated agents must follow the rules and patterns described in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

For any coding, architectural, or deployment questions, consult `.github/copilot-instructions.md` as the canonical source.

*If you believe a standard is missing or unclear, update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` directly.*
