    // 1. Factorio Mod Debug
    // Purpose: This is the default debug configuration for running and debugging your mod in the standard way.
    // Behavior: Launches Factorio with your mod enabled, focusing on the control stage (the runtime logic of your mod).
    // When to use: For typical mod development and debugging of your control scripts. When you want to set breakpoints, 
    // inspect variables, and step through code that runs while the game is being played (e.g., event handlers, GUI 
    // interactions, automation scripts).
    // Typical scenarios:
    // Testing how your mod responds to player actions or events.
    // Debugging automation or control scripts.
    // Inspecting game state changes as a result of mod logic.
    //
    // 2. Factorio Mod Debug (Settings & Data)
    // Purpose: This configuration enables debugging for the settings and data stages of your mod.
    // Behavior: By setting "hookSettings": true and "hookData": true, it allows you to debug code that runs during the 
    // mod’s settings and data loading phases (i.e., settings.lua, data.lua, and related files).
    // When to use: When you want to debug or inspect how your mod’s settings and data prototypes are defined or modified 
    // before the game starts (useful for troubleshooting data stage errors or settings logic).
    // When you need to troubleshoot or inspect how your mod defines settings (mod options) and data prototypes (entities, 
    // items, recipes, etc.) during the game’s initialization phase.
    // This is especially useful if your mod is failing to load, or if you are seeing errors or unexpected behavior in the 
    // way items, entities, or settings are defined.
    //
    // 3. Factorio Mod Debug (Profile)
    // Purpose: This configuration is for profiling your mod.
    // Behavior: The "hookMode": "profile" option tells the debugger to launch Factorio in a mode that collects performance 
    // data, helping you identify slow code or bottlenecks in your mod.
    // When to use: When you want to analyze and optimize the performance of your mod’s scripts.
    // When you want to analyze how much time your mod’s scripts are taking, identify performance bottlenecks, and optimize 
    // slow code.
    // This is important for larger mods or when users report lag or slowdowns attributed to your mod.
