Version: 0.0.7
Date: 2025-10-12
  Changes:
    - Removed conditional loading of gvv in control.lua. This should only be used for dev
    - Fixed desync issues in multiplayer and immediate GUI refresh for favorites bar
    - Added universal GUI conflict detection to prevent tag editor from opening when other mods' GUIs are active
    - Removed all chart_tag.last_user usage - Tag.owner_name is now the single source of truth for ownership tracking
  Bugfixes:
    - Added /tf_log_level command to change log level during gameplay without restarting (accepts: production, warn, error, debug)
    - Log level changes sync both ErrorHandler and DebugConfig systems for consistent logging behavior across all mod components
    - Fixed multiplayer issue where tag position updates were not immediately reflected in other players' favorites bars
    - Fixed issue where admin edits to another player's favorited tag were not updating that player's favorites bar - added ChartTagHelpers require and explicit update_tag_metadata() call
    - Fixed crash when admin moves another player's tag - missing LocaleUtils.format_tag_position_change_notification() function has been implemented, and locale string 'tag_position_changed' added for player notifications
    - Fixed issue where admin moving another player's tag would steal ownership - implemented persistent owner tracking in Tag storage to preserve original own
    - Added validation to prevent moving chart tags into uncharted territory - tag position is reverted and "cannot build" sound plays when attempting to move a tag to an uncharted area
