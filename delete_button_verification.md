# Delete Button Implementation Verification

## Requirements Implementation Status

### ✅ 1. Confirmation Dialog
- **Requirement**: Display a confirmation dialog when delete button is clicked
- **Implementation**: 
  - `handle_delete_btn()` function opens confirmation dialog via `tag_editor.build_confirmation_dialog()`
  - Dialog shows message: "Are you sure you want to delete this tag? This cannot be undone."
  - **Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### ✅ 2. Cancel Functionality  
- **Requirement**: If "No" is selected, close confirmation dialog and return to tag editor
- **Implementation**:
  - `handle_delete_cancel()` function handles `tf_confirm_dialog_cancel_btn` clicks
  - Closes confirmation dialog and returns focus to tag editor
  - **Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### ✅ 3. Confirm Functionality
- **Requirement**: If "Yes" is selected, destroy tag and chart_tag, remove from storage, reset tag_editor_data
- **Implementation**:
  - `handle_delete_confirm()` function handles `tf_confirm_dialog_confirm_btn` clicks
  - Uses existing `tag_destroy_helper.destroy_tag_and_chart_tag()` infrastructure
  - Clears `tag_editor_data` and closes both dialogs
  - Shows success message: "Tag deleted successfully"
  - **Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### ✅ 4. MOD RULE: Disable if Favorited by Others
- **Requirement**: Delete button disabled if tag is favorited by other players
- **Implementation**:
  - `setup_tag_editor_ui()` checks `tag.faved_by_players` array
  - Iterates through player indices, excludes current player
  - Disables delete button if any other player has favorited the tag
  - **Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### ✅ 5. MOD RULE: Owner-Only Deletion
- **Requirement**: Only owner (`tag.chart_tag.last_user == player.name`) can delete
- **Implementation**:
  - `setup_tag_editor_ui()` checks ownership: `tag.chart_tag.last_user == player.name`
  - Also allows deletion if `last_user` is empty (new tag)
  - Combines with favorite check for final `can_delete` determination
  - **Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### ✅ 6. Use Existing Infrastructure
- **Requirement**: Use existing functionality without duplicating code
- **Implementation**:
  - Leverages existing `tag_destroy_helper.destroy_tag_and_chart_tag()`
  - Uses existing `build_confirmation_dialog()` pattern
  - Reuses existing button enablement logic in `setup_tag_editor_ui()`
  - Uses existing `Cache.set_tag_editor_data()` for state management
  - **Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

## Code Files Modified

1. **gui/tag_editor/tag_editor.lua**
   - Added button references to `refs` object in `build()` function
   - Enhanced `setup_tag_editor_ui()` with ownership and favorite checking logic
   - Button enablement logic for delete button based on `can_delete`

2. **core/control/control_tag_editor.lua**
   - Added event handlers for confirmation dialog buttons
   - `handle_delete_confirm()` - executes deletion with validation
   - `handle_delete_cancel()` - cancels deletion and returns to editor
   - Both functions handle proper dialog management and user feedback

3. **locale/en/strings.cfg**
   - Added `tf-gui.tag_deleted_successfully=Tag deleted successfully`

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Owner Deleting Own Tag (No Other Favorites)
- **Expected**: Delete button enabled, deletion succeeds
- **Flow**: Click delete → confirmation dialog → click confirm → tag deleted + success message

### Scenario 2: Owner Deleting Tag Favorited by Others  
- **Expected**: Delete button disabled
- **Flow**: Delete button appears grayed out and non-clickable

### Scenario 3: Non-Owner Viewing Tag
- **Expected**: Delete button disabled  
- **Flow**: Delete button appears grayed out and non-clickable

### Scenario 4: Canceling Deletion
- **Expected**: Confirmation dialog closes, tag editor remains open
- **Flow**: Click delete → confirmation dialog → click cancel → back to tag editor

### Scenario 5: Permission Changes During Deletion
- **Expected**: Error message if permissions change between dialog and confirmation
- **Flow**: Click delete → another player favorites → click confirm → error message

## Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create a new tag as player A
- [ ] Verify delete button is enabled
- [ ] Click delete button → confirmation dialog appears
- [ ] Click cancel → returns to tag editor
- [ ] Click delete again → click confirm → tag deleted successfully
- [ ] Create tag as player A, have player B favorite it
- [ ] Verify delete button is disabled for player A
- [ ] Switch to player B, verify delete button is disabled (not owner)
- [ ] Verify all locale strings display correctly
- [ ] Test edge cases (empty tags, tags without chart_tag, etc.)

## Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

All requirements have been implemented according to specifications. The delete button functionality is ready for testing in-game.
