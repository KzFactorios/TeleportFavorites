## üîß Advanced Settings

TeleportFavorites includes a few advanced options for power users and tinkerers:

- **History Update Interval:** Controls how often your teleport history is refreshed. Lower values mean your recent teleports show up almost instantly; higher values can help performance in huge multiplayer games. (Set by server admin)
- **Chart Tag Click Radius:** Sets how close you need to click to select a map tag. A bigger radius makes it easier to select tags near your click, while a smaller radius requires more precision. (Set per player)

You can find these options in the Mod Settings menu (from the main menu or in-game via Settings > Mods > TeleportFavorites). Some settings may require a map restart or admin privileges to change.
